<p>This WordPress installation comes with a dashboard that enables hospitals to manage medical orders more efficiently. The dashboard includes several features that allow hospitals to create, track, and fulfill orders quickly and easily.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Order Creation:</strong> Hospitals can create new orders by filling out a form that captures essential information such as patient details, medical requirements, and delivery instructions.</li>
	<li><strong>Order Tracking:</strong> Hospitals can track the progress of their orders, from the time they are created to the time they are fulfilled.</li>
	<li><strong>Order Fulfillment:</strong> Hospitals can mark orders as fulfilled once they have been delivered to the patient. This helps ensure that all orders are properly tracked and accounted for.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizable Dashboard:</strong> The dashboard is fully customizable, allowing hospitals to add or remove fields, modify the layout, and adjust settings to fit their specific needs.</li>
</ul>
